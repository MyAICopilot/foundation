One solution to this crisis would be that, if the bonds magically went back to being worth 100 cents on the dollar, the banks would mostly be fine again. [1]  That seems improbable, though I guess one interesting mechanism would be if the banking crisis caused enough of a recession to drive long-term interest rates back to where they were in 2020. Then the bonds would be fine, though probably the banks would have credit losses.

Another solution to this crisis would be that, if the US government just bought the bonds from the banks at 100 cents on the dollar, the banks would mostly be fine again. Of course then the government would have paid 100 cents for stuff worth 85 cents, which seems bad. But through the magic of held-to-maturity accounting, you can sort of wave your hands and pretend that it’s not bad. If the government paid 100 cents today for a bond worth 85 cents, and then held it until it matured, it would get back 100 cents. (Plus interest, though not very much.) In some accounting sense, the government would not lose any money: It would get a below-market rate of interest on its money for the next few years, but it would technically get all of its money back.

And in fact this is kind of how the banks thought of these bonds: They were often in the banks’ held-to-maturity portfolios, meaning that they didn’t need to be marked down when they lost value due to changing interest rates. It’s just that, when people notice this stuff and deposits flee, you can’t hold the bonds to maturity, because you have to sell them, at a loss, to pay back depositors. But the government is not funded by short-term deposits, so it really can hold the bonds to maturity.

And in fact this is kind of, a little bit, a solution that the government hit on: In response to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, the US Federal Reserve announced a new Bank Term Funding Program that would lend the banks 100 cents on the dollar against bonds worth 85 cents on the dollar. This is not the same thing as buying the bonds at 100 cents on the dollar — the banks, rather than the government, are still economically on the hook for the losses — but it is motivated by the same sort of thinking. “Eventually these bonds will pay out 100 cents on the dollar, so it’s fine to lend 100 cents on the dollar against them, even if they are worth 85 cents today.”

But nobody has actually embraced a program of “the government will just buy the bonds back at par to make the banks healthy again,” because it is kind of an extreme transfer of losses from banks to taxpayers, even if you can wave your hands a bit and pretend it isn’t. [2]  But here’s this from Andrew Ackerman at the Wall Street Journal:

Banks have spent the past week or so testing what would be a clever gambit: Paying billions of dollars they collectively owe to replenish a federal deposit insurance fund using Treasurys instead of cash.

The idea—floated to regulators and lawmakers by PNC Financial Services Group and supported by others—could allow banks to take securities that are currently worth, say, 90 cents on the dollar, and give them to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. at full price. That would effectively shift losses clogging the banks’ balance sheets to the FDIC, according to people familiar with the proposal. ...

Proponents say nothing in the law says FDIC fees have to be paid in cash, so the agency could change its rules. They say the move, if greenlighted by the FDIC, would help the banking system address the way rising rates over the past year have saddled lenders with billions in losses on their portfolios of bonds. Those losses helped sink Silicon Valley Bank in March, sparking turmoil across the banking sector. …

Supporters say the government would hold the securities until maturity, allowing them to recover principal and interest on the debt. The government would suffer no losses, they say.

The FDIC has spent billions of dollars on its bank rescues — which is also a transfer of losses from banks to the government to make the banking system more solvent — but it is getting the money back by charging a special assessment to be paid by about 113 big  banks. If the banks pay the assessment with Treasuries that are worth 90 cents on the dollar, but that count for 100 cents on the dollar, then they get a little discount on the assessment and get to move unpleasant assets off their balance sheets.

Why stop there? They should pay their taxes in Treasuries. Really what they should do is pay executive bonuses in Treasuries: “We’re giving you a $1 million bonus, technically it is only worth $850,000 but if you hold it to maturity it’s a million.” 


Bed Bath & Beyond: beyond bankruptcy
At some point in, let’s say, January, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. was no longer a viable business. It was losing money, it had a lot of debt, it was in default on that debt and couldn’t pay. It looked around for somebody to buy the company — in or out of bankruptcy — and continue operating its stores, but it couldn’t find anyone. It prepared to file for bankruptcy, with a plan to liquidate the inventory, sell what it could, and give its creditors whatever was left, which would be a fraction of what it owed them.

And then somebody had the bright idea of, hey, why not sell a bunch of stock? Bed Bath was a meme stock, retail investors liked it, and Bed Bath could sell stock to them to raise cash to … well, to hand over to the creditors. It couldn’t sell stock to raise enough money to fix its problems and become a functional business again; that would require too much cash, and any cash that it did raise, it was contractually required to hand directly to its creditors. But if it sold a lot of stock, it would have some more cash to hand to the creditors. At this point in its life — the all-but-bankruptcy part of its life — Bed Bath was pretty much in the business of maximizing recovery for its creditors, and selling stock was a way to do that. [3]

And so it went out to sell worthless stock in a business that was no longer viable, to retail investors who did not realize that the stock was worthless and the business was no longer viable. To be fair, Bed Bath did tell them. If a company wants to sell stock, it has to put out a prospectus with disclosure about its business, and Bed Bath did, and the prospectus very much included phrases like “the Company expects that it will likely file for bankruptcy protection” and “our equity holders would likely not receive any recovery at all in a bankruptcy scenario.”

But two facts about meme-stock retail investors are (1) they ain’t reading all that and (2) they are always hopeful, so Bed Bath managed to raise several hundred million dollars in a series of stock offerings. Then it filed for bankruptcy last month, with, still, a plan to liquidate its assets and return what was left to creditors. It estimated that the liquidation would raise about $718 million, to pay back about $1.8 billion of debt, so the several hundred million dollars that it raised from the stock market was a big help. For the creditors. Not for the shareholders, obviously. They are getting zero.

Look! This is all debatable! What do I know? In January, Bed Bath did not know that it was no longer viable, and I do not know that now. It is in bankruptcy, but it has not liquidated everything yet. There is always some optionality, some chance that the business will recover in such a way that the company is viable and the stock is valuable. “Bed Bath & Beyond has pulled off long shot transactions several times in the last six months, so nobody should think Bed Bath & Beyond will not be able to do so again,” it said in its bankruptcy declaration. Maybe it will discover a $5 billion stash of diamonds in one of its stores and say “hey, we’re rich now, no need to liquidate, let’s pay back all our debt, refresh our inventory and get back to selling housewares.” Or maybe Elon Musk will put in a bid to buy it just for giggles, and then somehow be forced to follow through. And then the stock will be worth a lot, and the people who bought it for $0.30 in April will make a fortune. I do not expect this outcome, but I have been wrong before, and it is not, like, a physical impossibility.

Still I mean I have read the bankruptcy filings. Then there is this:

Passionate fans think Bed Bath & Beyond stock isn’t dead yet. 

Investors in meme stocks are typically eternal optimists, wagering on stocks they are excited about even if the underlying fundamentals are weak. Even in that world, the Bed Bath & Beyond bet is extreme. The company has said it expects shareholders will be wiped out, a projection that emphasizes the hard math of its chapter 11 filing.

“It is obviously the ultimate form of speculation, with buyers betting on the success of a reorganization on a worthless stock,” said Charles Geisst, a retired professor of finance at Manhattan College.

The stock now trades for pennies in the over-the-counter market, the province of companies that generally can’t trade on regular exchanges. Since it started trading on May 3, Bed Bath & Beyond stock has made up more than 9% of trades in the Pink Current Market, the over-the-counter market in which it resides, according to data from OTC Markets Group as of Friday. …

Michael “Jared” Martin, 25, said that most of his portfolio is tied up in shares of Bed Bath & Beyond and GameStop. When he received a bonus check from his IT job, he said he poured much of it into the retailer’s shares this March. He doesn’t plan to sell.

“I think that Bed Bath & Beyond, even in bankruptcy, is one of the best deals in the stock market,” said Martin, who is based near Louisville, Ky.

Martin, who started chatting with other traders on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets years ago, first got into the stock around the time that the billionaire investor Ryan Cohen did so last year. 

Martin has gradually increased his stake, while doing hours of analysis on the company and how it might exit bankruptcy. “You can call me a conspiracy theorist,” he said. 

As far as I can tell, Bed Bath kept selling stock until very close to the time it filed for bankruptcy. I … assume … it … has … stopped? When Hertz Global Holdings Inc. decided to sell stock to retail investors while in bankruptcy, it asked the bankruptcy court for permission first; the bankruptcy court was like “sure I guess, this is nuts but good for creditors so go ahead.” (The US Securities and Exchange Commission quickly shut it down though.) I assume that Bed Bath has not asked for permission to keep selling stock because it is not still selling stock. But, you know. Somebody is buying it! It trades several million dollars a day, and the price is up more than 100% since its lows of early May. If Bed Bath captured, like, 20% of that volume, by selling more stock in a public at-the-market offering, that would raise enough money to put a dent in its legal bills anyway. Bankruptcy is expensive, retail traders want to give someone money to buy Bed Bath stock, why shouldn’t the company take that money to spend on its bankruptcy?

Oh, reasons, sure, but honestly not that much has changed since Bed Bath last sold stock to retail investors. When it sold stock in April, things were pretty hopeless, and it warned buyers that it would probably go bankrupt and their stock would be worthless. Now it is May, things remain pretty hopeless, Bed Bath is in bankruptcy, the stock sure looks worthless, but people are still buying it. Before it filed for bankruptcy, Bed Bath was pretty ruthless about taking advantage of that demand. Why stop with bankruptcy?

Why stop with anything? Eventually Bed Bath’s bankruptcy will conclude. Current expectations are that it will conclude with liquidating the assets and cashing out the creditors at some fraction of what they are owed. But why not leave the corporate shell around, let its stock keep trading, let it keep selling stock, and send the proceeds to creditors? Give creditors cash now, plus a residual stream of quarterly payments from stock investors, just a little tax on people who want to keep trading Bed Bath stock long after it stops making sense. Somebody somewhere will have a conspiracy theory about Bed Bath’s revival that can survive the end of the bankruptcy case. Part of the value of Bed Bath & Beyond is that it is a meme stock with retail shareholders whom harsh economic reality cannot deter from buying the stock. That value belongs to the creditors now!
