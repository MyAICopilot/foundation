Framework: Sensitivity Analysis

Introduction:
Sensitivity Analysis is a technique used to assess the impact of changes in input variables or assumptions on the output or outcome of a model, decision, or project. It helps individuals or organizations understand the sensitivity or responsiveness of the results to different factors, allowing for better risk assessment and decision-making.

Variables and Assumptions:
Identify the key variables and assumptions that influence the model, decision, or project being analyzed. These variables can be quantitative (e.g., price, cost, interest rate) or qualitative (e.g., market conditions, customer preferences). Assumptions are the underlying beliefs or conditions on which the analysis is based.

Range Definition:
Determine the range of values or scenarios for each variable to be included in the sensitivity analysis. This includes defining the upper and lower bounds or specifying alternative values or scenarios that are likely to occur. The range should cover a meaningful spectrum of potential values or scenarios to capture the potential impacts.

Impact Assessment:
For each variable, assess the impact of changes in its value or scenario on the output or outcome of interest. This can be done by running the model or analysis multiple times, varying the values or scenarios of one variable while keeping others constant. Observe and record the resulting changes in the output or outcome.

Sensitivity Measures:
Quantify the sensitivity of the output or outcome to changes in each variable using appropriate sensitivity measures. Common sensitivity measures include:

Sensitivity Index: Measures the percentage change in the output for a given percentage change in the input variable.
Tornado Diagram: Illustrates the relative importance or impact of each variable by displaying their sensitivities on a horizontal bar chart.
Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between the input variable(s) and the output, showing how changes in the input variable(s) affect the output.
Interpretation of Results:
Analyze and interpret the sensitivity analysis results. Identify variables or assumptions that have the most significant impact on the output or outcome. Determine whether the results are consistent with expectations or if there are any surprising findings. Consider the implications of the sensitivity analysis results for decision-making and risk management.

Risk Assessment:
Use sensitivity analysis to assess the risks associated with the model, decision, or project. Identify variables or assumptions that, if changed, would have a substantial impact on the outcome or introduce the highest degree of uncertainty. This helps prioritize risk mitigation strategies and contingency planning.

Scenario Analysis:
Extend the sensitivity analysis to conduct scenario analysis by combining different values or scenarios for multiple variables. Explore various combinations of values to evaluate the potential outcomes under different scenarios. This allows for a more comprehensive assessment of risks and opportunities.

Communication and Reporting:
Effectively communicate the sensitivity analysis results to stakeholders, decision-makers, or relevant parties. Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, using visual aids such as graphs, charts, or tables to enhance understanding. Provide an explanation of the assumptions, methodologies, and limitations of the analysis.

Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:
Recognize that sensitivity analysis is not a one-time exercise but an ongoing process. Regularly review and update the analysis as new data, information, or assumptions become available. Incorporate feedback, monitor changing market conditions, and adapt the analysis to ensure it remains relevant and useful for decision-making.

By conducting sensitivity analysis, individuals or organizations can gain insights into the robustness of their models, decisions, or projects. Sensitivity analysis helps identify critical variables, evaluate risks, and inform decision-making by providing a clearer understanding of the potential impacts of changing assumptions or variables.
