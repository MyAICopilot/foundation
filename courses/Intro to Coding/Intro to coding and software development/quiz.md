A) Automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers
B) Automating the process of deploying software to production environments
C) Creating branches for new features or bug fixes
D) Reviewing code changes before merging them

Explanation: Continuous integration (CI) automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. It involves regularly integrating code changes and running automated tests to ensure code quality.

Answer: A) Automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers

Question 9: Which aspect of software development involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates?
A) Requirements gathering
B) Design and planning
C) Implementation and testing
