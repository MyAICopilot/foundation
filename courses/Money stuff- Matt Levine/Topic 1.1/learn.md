Slide 1:

Overview of short-selling: Borrowing a stock to sell and buy back later
Short sellers hope the stock price will fall, allowing them to buy it back for less
Short sellers must return borrowed stocks to lenders and pay any dividends earned
Slide 2:

Short sellers face problems if the stock becomes non-tradable
A non-tradable dividend also creates difficulties for short sellers
Some company executives may attempt to make their stock non-tradable to trap short sellers
Slide 3:

Companies should focus on running a good business instead of punishing short sellers
Short sellers can't harm a business that is fundamentally strong
A company's success should not depend on the stock price
Slide 4:

Exceptions: Banks and pump-and-dump scams may worry about short sellers
For banks, a falling stock price can erode confidence
For pump-and-dump scams, the business revolves around the stock price
Slide 5:

Overstock.com launched a short squeeze in 2019, under CEO Patrick Byrne
The plan involved issuing a special stock dividend on Overstockâ€™s own blockchain platform
Short sellers could not buy this non-tradable dividend to return to lenders
Slide 6:

The consequences of Overstock's dividend scheme:
Short sellers paid cash instead of returning the non-tradable dividend
The SEC investigated Overstock for alleged market manipulation
Slide 7:

Despite the scheme, short sellers were not significantly affected
Overstock's stock price fell about 70% after the announcement of the dividend
The company's stock price rebounded in 2020 after Byrne resigned
Slide 8:

AMC Entertainment Holdings has offered its shareholders non-tradable items
These include popcorn, non-fungible tokens, and APE preferred shares
AMC has not used these tactics to punish short sellers
Slide 9:

Overview of the MMTLP situation: A preferred stock backed by oil and gas assets
The stock was issued in 2021 by Torchlight Energy Resources, which merged with Meta Materials
The MMTLP shares were removed from circulation in December 2022
Slide 10:

The shares were poised for a short squeeze, causing a significant price surge
The shares were set to be converted into shares of a new, non-publicly traded company: Next Bridge Hydrocarbons
Finra halted trading in MMTLP in December 2022, surprising investors
Slide 11:

Many investors were stuck with non-tradable MMTLP shares
Some believe the stock transaction was a means to create a short squeeze
The underlying assets of the stock were dismissed as worthless by some analysts
Slide 12:

Overview of Next Bridge Hydrocarbons: An oil company with potentially worthless reserves
Next Bridge declined to comment on the situation
Meta Materials CEO said the spin-off was to protect shareholders from naked short selling
Slide 13:

The MMTLP tracking stock was replaced with non-tradable shares in Next Bridge
The common stock of Next Bridge was not listed on any stock exchange or market
The stock was not eligible for transfer through DTC, making it effectively untradeable
Slide 14:

Implication: Short sellers cannot buy back the stock, putting them in a difficult situation
However, shareholders also suffer as they cannot sell their shares
The strategy may protect against short selling, but it harms the shareholders.
Slide 15:

Conclusion: Focusing on punishing short sellers may not be beneficial for a company
It can harm the company's stock price and erode shareholder trust
Running a good business is a better strategy to deal with short sellers.
