Framework: Newsvendor Model

Introduction:
The Newsvendor Model is an inventory management model used to determine the optimal order quantity for a perishable or seasonal product. It helps businesses strike a balance between meeting customer demand and minimizing inventory holding costs.

Demand and Supply:
Understand the demand and supply dynamics of the product being managed by the Newsvendor Model. Demand refers to the quantity of the product that customers are expected to purchase during a specific period. Supply represents the available inventory or the quantity that can be ordered from the supplier.

Key Parameters:
Identify the key parameters used in the Newsvendor Model:

Unit Selling Price: The price at which the product is sold to customers.
Unit Cost: The cost of acquiring or producing each unit of the product.
Salvage Value: The value or price at which unsold units can be sold or salvaged after the selling season.
Holding Cost: The cost of holding or storing one unit of the product over a given period. This cost typically includes expenses such as storage, insurance, and depreciation.
Demand Distribution: The probability distribution that represents the uncertainty of demand during the selling season.
Objective:
Define the objective of the Newsvendor Model, which is typically to maximize the expected profit or minimize the expected cost. This objective considers both the revenue generated from sales and the cost associated with excess or unsold inventory.

Calculation of Critical Ratio:
Calculate the critical ratio, also known as the critical fractile or critical probability. The critical ratio represents the ratio of the salvage value to the selling price and is used to determine the optimal order quantity. It is the probability threshold at which it becomes more beneficial to order one more unit rather than selling one less.

Optimal Order Quantity:
Using the critical ratio and the demand distribution, calculate the optimal order quantity that maximizes the expected profit or minimizes the expected cost. The optimal order quantity is determined by finding the point where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of demand intersects the critical ratio.

Safety Stock:
Consider incorporating safety stock into the Newsvendor Model to account for demand variability or uncertainties. Safety stock is additional inventory held to mitigate the risk of stockouts and potential lost sales. The appropriate level of safety stock depends on factors such as demand variability, service level objectives, and the cost of stockouts.

Performance Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the Newsvendor Model by assessing the actual demand and comparing it to the optimal order quantity. Calculate metrics such as the fill rate, stockout rate, and profit to measure the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement.

Continuous Improvement:
Continuously refine the Newsvendor Model by incorporating updated demand data, improving demand forecasting techniques, and adjusting parameters based on feedback and performance evaluation. Regularly reassess and update the model to align with changes in market conditions, customer preferences, and business objectives.

Extensions and Considerations:
Consider extensions or variations of the Newsvendor Model, such as incorporating dynamic pricing, multiple product types, or capacity constraints. Account for factors such as lead time, production constraints, and supplier reliability to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the model to real-world inventory management scenarios.

By utilizing the Newsvendor Model, businesses can make informed decisions regarding order quantities for perishable or seasonal products. This model helps optimize inventory management, balance supply and demand, and minimize costs associated with excess inventory or stockouts. Effective implementation of the Newsvendor Model can lead to improved profitability and operational efficiency.
