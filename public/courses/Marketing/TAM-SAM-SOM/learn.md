Framework: TAM-SAM-SOM

TAM (Total Addressable Market):
TAM refers to the total market demand or revenue opportunity available for a particular product or service. It represents the maximum potential size of the market without any constraints or limitations. TAM represents the total market size in terms of revenue or units, assuming that the product or service is available to all potential customers and there are no competitive or market-specific factors influencing demand.

SAM (Serviceable Available Market):
SAM represents the portion of the TAM that a company or business can realistically target and serve. It is the specific segment of the market that aligns with the company's target market, capabilities, and resources. SAM takes into account factors such as geographic limitations, customer preferences, market segmentation, and the company's ability to effectively reach and serve a particular subset of the total market demand.

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
SOM represents the portion of the SAM that a company or business can realistically capture and obtain within a specific timeframe. It takes into consideration factors such as competition, market share, and the company's marketing and sales strategies. SOM reflects the estimated market share or revenue that a company can achieve based on its current resources, market positioning, and competitive advantage.

Key Considerations:

Market Segmentation: TAM, SAM, and SOM are typically defined based on market segmentation, which involves dividing the total market into distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics, needs, and preferences.

Market Sizing: To estimate TAM, SAM, and SOM, companies often rely on market research, data analysis, customer surveys, industry reports, and other relevant sources of information. These methods help in quantifying the market potential and identifying the target segment sizes.

Growth Opportunities: TAM, SAM, and SOM analysis also provide insights into potential growth opportunities for a company. By understanding the size and dynamics of the market, businesses can identify areas for expansion, product development, or market penetration strategies.

Market Penetration: Companies may start by targeting a specific segment within the SAM to establish a foothold and gradually expand their reach. As the company gains traction and resources, it may aim to capture a larger portion of the SAM and eventually increase its market share within the SOM.

Continuous Evaluation: TAM, SAM, and SOM are not static and may change over time due to market dynamics, competition, technological advancements, and other factors. Therefore, it is important for companies to regularly evaluate and reassess their market sizing estimates to stay aligned with evolving market conditions.

By understanding TAM, SAM, and SOM, companies can effectively assess the market potential, define their target market segments, allocate resources strategically, and develop focused marketing and sales strategies to maximize their market share and revenue within a specific market.
