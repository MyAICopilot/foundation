Summary Slides: Growth Chapter from "Startup Playbook" by Sam Altman

Slide 1:
Topic: Growth

Growth and momentum are crucial for successful execution.
Lack of growth cannot be solved by anything but growth itself.
Lack of growth leads to demoralization and burnout among founders and employees.

Slide 2:
How to maintain momentum:
Make growth the top priority and measure it consistently.
Establish a single growth metric for the company.
Examples: Airbnb founders visualized growth targets and displayed them prominently. Facebook formed a prestigious growth group during a growth slowdown.

Slide 3:
Driving growth:
Maintain a list of growth blockers and address them.
Evaluate each action based on its potential to optimize growth.
Internal transparency about metrics and financials keeps everyone focused.
Retention is as important as new user acquisition, don't rely solely on vanity metrics.

Slide 4:
Establishing momentum:
Set aggressive but achievable goals and review progress monthly.
Celebrate wins and share information internally about strategy and customer feedback.
Internal and external "drumbeat" of progress with new features, customers, hires, revenue milestones, partnerships, etc.

Slide 5:
Common traps and misconceptions:
Growing fast with inefficiencies is an opportunity to fix and drive more growth.
Avoid overthinking problems that are too far in the future.
"Do things that don't scale" in the early stages, but ensure good unit economics in the long run.

Slide 6:
More traps and misconceptions:
Don't get demoralized by absolute growth numbers; small numbers can lead to exponential growth.
Deals with other companies and big press launches rarely deliver growth.
Focus on building a product users love and test various growth strategies to find what works.

Slide 7:
Sales and marketing for growth:
Sales and marketing are valuable for accelerating growth.
They are not bad words; they require a great product as a foundation.
Embrace sales and learn to ask users to use your product and pay for it.
